# IoT-Wood-Equilibrium-Moisture-Content

Paper link: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7873612

Information of moisture content in wood is an important factor for development of wooden products in industries. Contemporary solutions are inadequate to monitor the wood moisture content remotely. This paper presents an Internet of Things based novel approach to measure and monitor moisture content of wood (IoTEMC). Plotly and Xively enabled cloud services are incorporated so as to register the raw values of IoTEMC into the remote IoT cloud servers for permanent storage. Real-time visualization is performed on the captured values to aware the user about the condition of the wood. Real-time statistical analytics is performed on the wood. Mean value, SD and SE of the wood moisture content is 14.7471, 0.029, and 0.00289, respectively. Serial output helps the user to monitor the process of capture of data, network connectivity, and data transmission towards the clouds.
